<instructions>
You MUST read AGENTS.md and project/architecture/ADR/DECISION-LOG.md before starting.
You MUST inspect the root justfile when present to understand commands and evidence available to agents.
You MUST read all existing work-item documentation under project/work-items/ to learn the established format.
You MUST run git history analysis to surface recurring issue-quality gaps before drafting the issue.
You MUST analyze closed issues and their post-PR fix commits to identify categories of missed acceptance criteria.
You MUST use history findings only to sharpen the problem statement and acceptance criteria.
You MUST structure every issue with all sections defined in ISSUE_SECTIONS.
You MUST apply "Less is more" by including only context and acceptance criteria essential to define the problem.
You MUST apply "KISS" by preferring the smallest set of clear, independently verifiable acceptance criteria.
You MUST format every acceptance criterion as a markdown checkbox (`- [ ]` for unchecked).
You MUST wrap the acceptance criteria list with `<!-- ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_START -->` and `<!-- ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_END -->` HTML comment markers so downstream agents can machine-parse them.
You MUST place exactly one start marker and one end marker; only `- [ ]` checkbox list items and optional group headings may appear between them.
You MUST group acceptance criteria under subheadings (e.g., **Core**, **Edge Cases**, **Verification**) inside the markers.
You MUST match the acceptance-criteria formatting documented in project/work-items/README.md.
You MUST write acceptance criteria that autonomous agents can complete with repository tools and declared agent capabilities.
You MUST keep each acceptance criterion bounded, deterministic, observable, and independently verifiable.
You MUST ensure requested tests or validation produce evidence an agent can collect.
You MUST decompose broad outcomes so RPIV can map them to finite tasks and validation.
You MUST reject criteria requiring unavailable credentials, inaccessible systems, unsupported hardware, indefinite observation, or exhaustive proof.
You MUST reject manual-only or subjective validation unless the user explicitly requires it and identifies an available reviewer.
You MUST NOT require production-only experiments or destructive validation when a safe reproducible check can prove the outcome.
You MUST dispatch a rubber-duck subagent to critique the draft before creating the issue.
You MUST incorporate rubber-duck feedback into the final issue before creation.
You MUST create the issue via `gh issue create` after rubber-duck approval.
You MUST output the created issue URL using format:ISSUE_CREATED after successful creation.
You MUST NOT create an issue without rubber-duck review.
You MUST NOT include a proposed solution, technical considerations, implementation plan, architecture decision, technology choice, dependency choice, API design, file path, or test framework unless the user explicitly provided it as part of the problem to preserve.
You MUST NOT include secrets, credentials, or personal data in generated issue text.
You SHOULD propose acceptance criteria that cover security, accessibility, validation, error states, and data integrity when relevant, phrased as observable outcomes rather than implementation steps.
You SHOULD identify edge cases based on patterns from previous issues without prescribing how to solve them.
You SHOULD prefer repository-local, repeatable evidence over external or manual evidence.
You MAY suggest labels based on the issue content.

AGENT_FEASIBILITY_RULES: YAML<<
- Acceptance criteria must be achievable by autonomous agents using repository access and declared agent capabilities.
- Validation must be finite, repeatable, and produce inspectable evidence.
- Criteria must not require unavailable accounts, secrets, devices, production access, or human intuition.
- Criteria must not demand exhaustive proof, indefinite monitoring, or nondeterministic success.
- Human review is allowed only when explicitly required and an available reviewer is identified.
- Criteria describe observable outcomes without prescribing implementation or test frameworks.

    - Validation is bounded, repeatable, safe, and produces inspectable evidence
    - External or human prerequisites are identified explicitly instead of becoming impossible agent tasks
- category: reliability
  title: Reliability Outcomes

    - Existing data and behavior remain intact unless the issue explicitly requests a change
    - Failure states are visible and recoverable for the affected user flow
- category: documentation
  title: Documentation Outcomes

RUBBER_DUCK_PROMPT: TEXT<<
You are a critical reviewer. Read the draft GitHub issue below and challenge it:

1. Are any acceptance criteria missing or too vague?
2. Do the acceptance criteria describe observable outcomes instead of implementation steps?
3. Is the draft free from proposed solutions, architecture decisions, technology choices, package choices, API designs, file paths, and test-framework prescriptions?
4. Are edge cases identified for error states, empty states, repeated actions, and concurrent access when relevant?
5. Are unstated assumptions made explicit without constraining how RPIV should solve the issue?
6. Can the RPIV Research and Plan stages decide the approach from this issue without being preempted?
7. Can autonomous agents complete every criterion using repository access and declared agent capabilities?
8. Are all tests and validation finite, repeatable, evidence-producing, and free from unavailable external dependencies?
9. Does any criterion require subjective judgment, manual-only work, indefinite observation, production access, or exhaustive proof?

Reply with a numbered list of issues found, or "APPROVED" if the draft is ready.
