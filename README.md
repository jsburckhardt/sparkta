## Engineering workflow

This repository is a **template**, not a Foreman application. Start a new
project with `bootstrap`, or use `onboard-repo` to discover an existing project's
stack and commands. Those agents record the project's capabilities and can
configure thin worker-operation recipes when explicitly requested. Foreman
does not impose Python or another implementation language.

**Foreman owns the mission; RPIV delivers one issue.** Give the `foreman` agent a
PRD or product direction to build and maintain a dependency graph of GitHub
issues, retain repository context, and schedule isolated RPIV workers within a
configured capacity when that project has enabled worker execution.

```text
Product direction -> Foreman -> issue dependency graph
                          -> tmux session: foreman
                             foreman | rpiv-21 | rpiv-22
                                        |         |
                                  .trees/issue-21  .trees/issue-22
                                        |         |
                                  Copilot CLI + RPIV
                                  Research -> Plan -> Implement -> Verify
```

Foreman is optional: use `rpiv` directly for a single issue. Each worker exposes
structured state/events; a delivered PR is not treated as merged integration.
Foreman passes a bounded, versioned assignment to each issue worker and
requires typed status/results; after integrating the delivered issues it runs
the project's full verification before declaring the mission complete.
The template ships no scheduler runtime and does not start workers automatically.
Enabling managed execution approves `--yolo` for the controller and all managed
Copilot launches/resumes. Foreman reviews each delivered PR against expected
outcomes, sends findings to its RPIV worker, and re-reviews the updated PR.
Mission context can be maintained before execution is configured; standalone
RPIV remains available with its own permission policy.
See [Foreman usage and operations](docs/foreman.md) for setup, graph format,
permission modes, start/resume/pause, and worker communication.
