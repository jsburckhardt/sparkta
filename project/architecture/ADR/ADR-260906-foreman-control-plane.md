# ADR-260906-foreman-control-plane: Foreman Control Plane

## Status

Accepted

## Context

RPIV delivers one issue. A product mission can span dependent issues,
concurrent workers, and integration decisions. Soft Factory is a template for
many projects, not an application that should impose an orchestration service
or implementation language on every consumer.

## Decision

Foreman is an APS agent above RPIV. It owns repository understanding, mission
decomposition, the work graph, readiness and capacity decisions, worker
coordination, recovery, and mission completion. Those behaviors stay in its
prompt and shared contracts, not in a Python scheduler or equivalent runtime.

The template ships the agents, contracts, documentation, and a minimal root
`justfile`. When a project starts, bootstrap selects its actual stack and
commands with the user; onboarding discovers and preserves an existing stack.
Both can record a project profile and, with explicit approval, add thin
worker-operation recipes appropriate to that project. Foreman can understand
and plan a mission without enabling worker execution.

V1 uses GitHub Issues as deliverables. A project opting into the Copilot
CLI/tmux adapter uses one `foreman` session, `rpiv-N` worker identities, and
isolated `.trees/issue-N` worktrees. RPIV is the primary coordinator in each
worker CLI session; its four stages are leaf agents. Research -> Plan ->
Implement -> Verify is unchanged.

Foreman reviews each delivered PR against the original mission outcomes, issue
criteria, architecture constraints, diff, and verification evidence. This is
mission-level acceptance, not another RPIV stage. If the PR falls short,
Foreman sends head-specific findings to its delivering RPIV worker. RPIV owns
corrections, independent re-verification, and updating the same PR. Foreman
re-reviews the new head before accepting delivery for integration.

The explicitly approved managed-session permission policy is `--yolo`:
controller, issue-generator, and RPIV CLI launches and resumptions use that
flag. Project initialization records approval when enabling this mode; it is
not requested again for every tool. Worker execution still requires project
opt-in and configured operations. Standalone sessions keep their own permission
policy. A thin shared launch recipe enforces the managed invocation without
adding scheduling logic.

The agent owns `.foreman/mission.json` and `.foreman/registry.json` as data.
The consuming project's non-secret `.foreman/project.json` records configured
commands and capabilities. RPIV writes a current state snapshot and immutable
event files using its host file tools. Typed message files carry communication;
an enabled tmux adapter may signal that new data is available. Notifications
and terminal output are not authoritative state.

Command recipes perform concrete operations such as creating a worktree,
opening a console, launching Copilot, and inspecting GitHub delivery. They do
not parse the graph, calculate readiness, mutate the mission, or decide
acceptance. A project may later adopt a small persistence helper if a proven
need justifies it through its own architecture process.

This amends the initial implementation choice: remove the Python control
runtime and its dependency rather than translate that runtime into Bash or
another language.

## Alternatives

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Why Rejected |
|-------------|------|------|--------------|
| Ship a Python scheduler and state engine | Deterministic mechanics | Imposes a runtime and splits APS ownership | Too much infrastructure for a reusable template |
| Port the same engine to shell or JavaScript | Different dependency profile | Still duplicates agent orchestration | Does not solve the ownership problem |
| Expand RPIV into a mission agent | Fewer entrypoints | Mixes issue delivery and project coordination | Breaks the issue boundary |
| Enable workers when the template is cloned | Immediate activity | No project-specific commands, scope, or permission agreement | Unsafe default |
| Require a different tracker or Herd/HERDR | Potential richer operations | Unevaluated dependency and integration cost | Defer; keep contracts transport-independent |

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consumers choose their own language, package manager, and operating commands.
- Foreman behavior has one owner: the APS agent.
- Repositories may use standalone RPIV or enable Foreman workers when ready.

### Negative
- Prompt-level reconciliation is not an automatic transactional storage engine.
- Worker execution needs explicitly configured project recipes and permissions.
- Interrupted or inconsistent data requires reconciliation, not guessed success.
- `--yolo` grants broad tool, path, and URL permissions. Worktrees isolate Git
  changes, not host access; only trusted repositories and environments should
  be enabled. Credentials and explicit host deny rules still apply.

### Neutral
- Foreman does not automatically merge PRs or delete worktrees. Managed sessions
  use the approved broad permission policy, not a guarantee of credentials or
  exemption from host restrictions.
- GitHub and Copilot access are required for the operations that use them, not
  for editing the template or recording local context.
