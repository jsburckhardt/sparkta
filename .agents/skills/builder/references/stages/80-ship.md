# ship

> Sub-skill — part of a verb library. Knows nothing about any flow:
> no stage ids, no successor/predecessor names, no flow commands.
> Composition is the bundling flow's job.

**Verb**: ship
**Purpose**: Get the work **out** — push the branch, open a pull request (using repo PR guidance when present), watch the PR's CI checks, and report problems. The actual merge is **optional** (platform auto-merge, or a separate confirm-gated step); a meaningfully diverged base is handed off to the upstream-**reconcile** excursion rather than merged locally here. Best-effort throughout: degrades to a printed instruction when `gh` is absent, the repo is on its default branch with nothing to push, or no CI is configured — it never crashes out of a `gh` call.

**Consumes**: an implemented + reviewed plan (review verdict APPROVE / clean, or an explicit user override); plan folder resolvable (`*-plan.md`, or a legacy `*-spec.md`); a git repository. Optional inputs (all best-effort, each degrades): a working branch with commits ahead of the base; `gh` CLI present + authenticated; repo PR guidance — `.github/pull_request_template.md` (or `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE*`), `CONTRIBUTING*`, `CODEOWNERS`, the repo's default base branch.

**Flags**: `--plan "<abs path to docs/plans/<ordinal>-<slug>/>"` (optional; auto-detect from cwd) · `--base "<branch>"` (optional; PR base, default = repo default branch) · `[--no-watch]` (optional; open the PR but skip the CI-check watch) · `[--draft]` (optional; open the PR as a draft) · `[--watch-cap "<minutes>"]` (optional; bound the check-watch, default 20).

**Produces**: a pushed branch; an opened (or reused) PR behind an explicit confirm; a ship report at `${PLAN_DIR}/assets/ship/${DATE}/ship-report.md` (PR URL, base, check results, any failing checks + their details link, a whole-plan **Deferred & Noteworthy** rollup, resume note); terminal summary = PR URL + check status + (on red) the fix-loop offer + (when non-empty) the deferred-items count. An actual merge is produced **only** on a separate typed `PROCEED`.

**Side effects**: outward-facing — `git push` (confirm #1), `gh pr create` (confirm #2), and an **optional** `gh pr merge` / `git merge` **only** on typed `PROCEED`. Each is public; **never** fired on a generic "yes". Plus one **non-gated** action: `harness telemetry sync` flushes the counts-only telemetry buffer to its out-of-tree `refs/harness-telemetry/*` shard refs — it publishes no work (no branch, no PR), is reversible/prunable, and is fail-safe, so it runs **without a confirm** (see Safety). No source files are modified.

## dd-native plans: the PR body renders the proof (plan 071)

The plan folder archived at post-flight, so the corpus is read from `docs/plans/archive/<ord>-<slug>/`. Read it with the CLI rather than by parsing markdown:

```bash
ARCHIVE="docs/plans/archive/<ord>-<slug>"
harness plan validate "${ARCHIVE}/plan.dd.json" --complete   # must be green before you claim it is
harness plan pr-body  "${ARCHIVE}/plan.dd.json" --pin-head   # the AC table, every link pinned at HEAD
harness dd get "${ARCHIVE}/plan.dd.json#acceptance_criteria" # the closed criteria + their receipts
harness dd graph map "${ARCHIVE}/plan.dd.json#acceptance_criteria/ac-XXXX" --direction in
```

`plan pr-body` emits `data.markdown` — paste it into the PR body verbatim. It renders each closed criterion beside the evidence it rests on: `proven_by`, its `pressure` instrument, and the incoming `satisfies` naming the tasks that accounted for it.

Two things it does on purpose:

- **It refuses an unclosed corpus** (`E457`), naming the open rows. Do not work around that by writing the table by hand — a table that quietly omits the criteria that were not met makes a reviewer's approval mean less than they think it does. Close the rows through the dd surfaces, or say plainly in the PR that they are open.
- **`--pin-head` derives the link prefix** from the origin remote and the HEAD commit, and REFUSES if it cannot (no remote, no commit, an unrecognised remote shape). Do not assemble the URL yourself from `git remote` output — that is how a body full of 404s reaches a reviewer, and broken links discredit the surface faster than a missing one. If the derivation refuses, pass `--link-base <url>` explicitly and say why in the ship report.

The last read shows the incoming work-accounting for one criterion — which tasks `satisfies` it — which is exactly what a human reviewer wants beside the claim.

## Procedure

Get the work out: push → open PR (repo-guidance-aware) → watch checks → report problems → (optional) merge. Every outward-facing action is behind its own explicit confirmation; everything degrades to a printed instruction rather than an error.

> Elegance: the ship report is **output**. Record the PR URL, the base, the check verdicts, and the resume note — the facts a human needs to act — not a play-by-play. Doctrine + the seven-function line test: `references/00-routing.md` § Shared conventions.

> **Safety**: push, PR-open, and merge are outward-facing. They each pause for an explicit go-ahead, the merge for a typed `PROCEED` specifically. Reading state (`git status`, `gh pr view`, `gh pr checks`) is always safe and never gated. **Telemetry sync is the one deliberate ungated push**: it writes only out-of-tree, counts-only shard refs (never your branch or PR), is reversible, and is fail-safe — so it flushes without asking, like the reads.

## Execution Flow

0) Flush telemetry (always; NO confirm). Ship is the work's exit — and a natural
   session/plan close — so flush the ambient telemetry buffer first, before the gated steps:
   ```
   harness telemetry sync
   ```
   Best-effort + fail-safe: it pushes ONLY the out-of-tree
   `refs/harness-telemetry/<date>/<session>` shard refs (counts-only, team/repo-grained,
   never your branch or a PR; reversible/prunable), so unlike the branch push it needs
   **no gate**. Run it once, swallow any error (it must never block or delay the ship),
   and decouple it from confirm #1 — telemetry flushes whether or not you go on to push/PR.
   Honour the switches: **skip** entirely if `HARNESS_NO_TELEMETRY=1`; if
   `HARNESS_NO_TELEMETRY_AUTOSYNC=1` (the user opted out of unprompted pushes) skip the
   auto-flush and just note `harness telemetry sync` can be run manually.

1) Input Resolution

   - PLAN_DIR = provided --plan OR auto-detect from cwd (look for *-plan.md, or a legacy *-spec.md).
     Completed plans live under `docs/plans/archive/<ord>-<slug>/` (the close-out stage archives them
     pre-ship), so resolve there FIRST; a `docs/plans/<ord>-<slug>/` path that no longer exists has
     almost certainly moved to the archive — probe `docs/plans/archive/<same basename>/` before erroring.
   - PLAN_SLUG = plan folder name minus ordinal (e.g. "035-flow-ship-stage" -> "flow-ship-stage")
   - BASE = provided --base OR repo default branch:
     `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` (fallback:
     `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^origin/@@'`, then `main`)
   - DATE = `date +%Y-%m-%d`
   - BRANCH = `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null` (empty = detached HEAD)

2) Preconditions & degradation (read-only probes; on any miss, PRINT an instruction and STOP
   the affected outward action — never crash, never call `gh pr create` blindly):

   a) **Nothing to ship as a PR** — detect and degrade to a printed instruction (AC-10):
      - `BRANCH` is empty (detached HEAD), OR
      - `BRANCH == BASE` (on the default branch — the common "main-only" case), OR
      - no commits ahead of base: `git rev-list --count ${BASE}..HEAD` is `0` (prefer `origin/${BASE}` after `git fetch origin ${BASE}` so a stale local base doesn't mask un-pushed commits — keep this consistent with the divergence probe in step 8)
      → print, then stop the PR path:
      ```
      ⚠️ Nothing to open a PR from: you're on "${BRANCH:-detached HEAD}" with no commits ahead of ${BASE}.
         Create a feature branch first, then re-run:
           git switch -c ${PLAN_SLUG}
           git push -u origin ${PLAN_SLUG}
      ```
      (Do NOT invoke `gh pr create` with head == base — it fails; this printed instruction replaces it.)

   b) **No remote / no upstream** (AC-06): `git remote get-url origin` fails →
      print `git remote add origin <url>` guidance and stop the push path.

   c) **`gh` absent or unauthenticated** (AC-06): `gh auth status` fails (or `command -v gh` empty) →
      the whole PR path degrades to push + a compare URL:
      ```
      gh not available — pushing the branch and printing a compare URL instead:
        git push -u origin ${BRANCH}
        <remote-web-url>/compare/${BASE}...${BRANCH}
      ```
      Run the push (still behind confirm #1), print the compare URL, write the report, stop.

   d) **Dirty tree**: `git status --porcelain` non-empty → note the uncommitted files; only committed
      work ships. Offer to proceed (push existing commits) or stop so the user can commit.

3) Read repo PR guidance (best-effort; each optional — absence is normal, never an error) (AC-03):

   | Source | Read | Use |
   |---|---|---|
   | `.github/pull_request_template.md` / `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE*` | template body | seed the PR body |
   | `CONTRIBUTING*` (root or `.github/`) | PR conventions | honor any title/label/checklist convention |
   | `CODEOWNERS` | owners | let `gh` auto-request reviewers; do not hand-assign |
   | `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef` | default base | confirm BASE when `--base` not given |

   **Absent (default path)**: title = the plan's feature name (from `*-plan.md` h1 / Summary);
   body = the plan's `## Business Specification` § Summary (or the plan summary) + a trailing
   "🤖 Generated with the SDD flow" line. Quote the plan, don't invent scope.

   **dd-native plan? Append the proof table.** After the summary, append the output of
   `harness plan pr-body "${PLAN_DIR}/plan.dd.json" --pin-head` (see the section above).
   The body then carries every closed criterion beside the evidence it rests on, one click
   away, which is what turns the human checkpoint from "do I trust this summary?" into
   "do I agree with this evidence?". If it refuses — `E457` on an unclosed corpus, or a
   `--pin-head` derivation it will not guess at — do NOT hand-write the table: report the
   refusal and let the human decide, because the value of the table is precisely that
   nobody typed it.

4) Build the **Deferred & Noteworthy** rollup (read-time, whole-plan; informs the outbound gates; never a gate):

   Aggregate what's about to ship that no human explicitly signed off — across every phase of the plan:
   - `Deferred` / `Noteworthy` rows from each phase's `## Discoveries & Learnings` table (execution logs / tasks.md / plan)
   - skipped / blocked tasks still open in the task table(s)
   - acceptance criteria not yet met (plan `## Acceptance Criteria`)
   - `TODO` / `FIXME` / `HACK` / `XXX` introduced in the shipped diff:
     `git grep -nE 'TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX' -- $(git diff --name-only origin/${BASE}..HEAD)` (best-effort; skip cleanly on error)
   - deferred review findings recorded in the execution log

   This is a **read-time view** — no `DEFERRALS.md`, nothing persisted beyond the ship report. Empty across all
   sources → record "none" (silence is the all-clear). It surfaces at the open-PR gate (step 6) and in the report;
   it **never blocks** — the human ships with eyes open, not with a green light withheld.

5) Confirm gate #1 — PUSH (its own gate; AC-04). Print the exact command, then ask to proceed:
   ```
   git push -u origin ${BRANCH}
   ```
   On a clear go-ahead → run it. (This confirm covers ONLY the push.)

6) Confirm gate #2 — OPEN PR (separate, outward-facing; NEVER inherits the push "yes"; AC-04, AC-06):
   - **Print the Deferred & Noteworthy rollup (step 4) first** when non-empty — so the reviewer sees what's in the
     box *before* the PR opens. Informational; the confirm still only opens the PR.
   - **PR already exists** for the branch? `gh pr view --json url,state,number 2>/dev/null` returns one →
     skip create, reuse it (capture URL + number), jump to step 7.
   - Else print the exact command, then ask to proceed:
     ```
     gh pr create --base ${BASE} --head ${BRANCH} \
       --title "<title>" --body "<body>" [--draft]
     ```
     On a clear go-ahead → run it. Capture PR_URL + PR_NUMBER from the output.

7) Watch CI checks (skip entirely if `--no-watch`) — BOUNDED (AC-05):
   - Enumerate once: `gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER}`.
     - **No checks reported** ("no checks reported on the … branch") → report "no CI configured for
       this PR", write the report, STOP (this is success, not failure).
   - Else watch with a bound = `--watch-cap` minutes (default 20), interval 30s. Either
     `timeout ${cap}m gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER} --watch --interval 30`, or a polling loop that
     re-reads `gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER}` until all checks resolve or the cap elapses:
     - **all pass** → report green.
     - **any fail** → capture the failing check name(s) + details URL from `gh pr checks` output;
       report fail; **offer a fix-loop** (the bundling flow renders the actual command — describe it in
       verb terms: "a red check's fixes go back through the **implement** verb, then re-run **ship**").
       Never block.
     - **still pending at the cap** → report "checks still running after ${cap}m — not blocking;
       re-check with `gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER}`", STOP.

8) Optional merge — NEVER automatic; present two gated paths (AC-04):
   - **Platform auto-merge** (preferred — lets the platform merge when checks pass + approvals land),
     behind a confirm:
     ```
     gh pr merge ${PR_NUMBER} --auto --squash
     ```
   - **Immediate merge** — ONLY on a typed `PROCEED` (outward + irreversible-ish):
     ```
     gh pr merge ${PR_NUMBER} --squash   # or --merge, per repo convention
     ```
     On `ABORT` (or anything but `PROCEED`) → leave the PR open; the ship report records where to resume.
   - **Diverged base** — if the base has meaningfully advanced since the branch point
     (`git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/${BASE}` is large, or a quick `git merge-tree` shows overlap),
     do NOT attempt a local merge here. Report the divergence and hand off to the upstream-reconcile
     excursion (the bundling flow offers it). All handoff context is git-derived.

9) Write the ship report + terminal summary (templates below).

## Ship Report Template

Write to `${PLAN_DIR}/assets/ship/${DATE}/ship-report.md` (create the folders if missing):

```markdown
# Ship Report — ${PLAN_SLUG}

**Generated**: ${TIMESTAMP}
**Branch**: ${BRANCH} → **Base**: ${BASE}
**PR**: ${PR_URL} (#${PR_NUMBER})  ·  **State**: ${open|merged|reused|degraded-no-gh}

## Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| ${name} | ✅/❌/⏳ | ${url} |

**Verdict**: all green | ${N} failing | no CI configured | still running at cap

## Failing checks (if any)

- **${check}** — ${details-url}
  Recommended: fix via the implement verb, then re-run ship.

## Repo guidance applied

- PR template: ${found|none → default body}
- Base: ${BASE} (${default branch|--base override})
- Reviewers: ${CODEOWNERS auto-requested|none}

## Deferred & Noteworthy

_Everything punted across the build that's about to ship — surfaced so the go-decision is informed. Never a blocker._

| Kind | Item | Where | Reason / note |
|------|------|-------|---------------|
| Deferred / Noteworthy | ${item} | ${phase / file:line} | ${why} |

(none → "Nothing deferred — all acceptance criteria met, no open markers.")

## Resume

- Merge not yet done → ${platform auto-merge armed | awaiting typed PROCEED | base diverged → reconcile}
- Re-check checks: `gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER}`
```

## Success Message

```
✅ Shipped: PR ${PR_URL} (#${PR_NUMBER})
   Branch ${BRANCH} → ${BASE}
   Checks: ${all green | N failing | no CI | still running}
   Report: ${PLAN_DIR}/assets/ship/${DATE}/ship-report.md
   ${deferred: "⚠️ ${N} deferred/noteworthy items rolled up in the report — review before merge." }
   ${on red: "Red check — fixes go back through implement, then re-run ship." }
   ${merge: "Merge is optional — auto-merge armed / type PROCEED to merge now / base diverged → reconcile." }
```

Degraded (no `gh`):
```
✅ Pushed ${BRANCH} → compare: <remote-web-url>/compare/${BASE}...${BRANCH}
   (gh unavailable — open the PR in the web UI; re-run ship once gh is authed to watch checks.)
```

## Notes

- **Read-only by default until a confirm.** Probes (`git status`, `gh pr view/checks`) never change state.
- **Push / PR / merge are three separate gates.** A "yes" to push is not a "yes" to open a PR;
  a merge needs a typed `PROCEED`.
- **All context is git/`gh`-derived.** No external services beyond the repo's own remote + checks.
- **Best-effort.** Missing `gh`, main-only repo, no CI, existing PR — each degrades to a printed
  instruction or a reused artifact, never a hard failure.
```

---

## Exit

Print the output-contract summary (✅ block: PR URL, base, check status, report path; on red the fix-loop offer; merge left optional). Then STOP. Do not name a next stage. If invoked standalone, end with exactly: "Routing is the flow's job — run the parent flow bare to continue."
