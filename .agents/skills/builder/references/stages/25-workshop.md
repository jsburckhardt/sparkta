# workshop

> Sub-skill — part of a verb library. Knows nothing about any flow:
> no stage ids, no successor/predecessor names, no flow commands.
> Composition is the bundling flow's job.

**Verb**: workshop
**Purpose**: Create a decision-focused design note — a working reference — that resolves a complex concept before architecture, from the spec's Workshop Opportunities or any topic needing deep exploration. Optional — can run any time during planning.
**Consumes**: an existing plan folder (`docs/plans/<ordinal>-<slug>/`) · business source — the `## Business Specification` of `${PLAN_DIR}/<slug>-plan.md` (unified), else a legacy `${PLAN_DIR}/<slug>-spec.md` (required for `--from-spec`, otherwise context) · `assets/research-dossier.md` (optional; legacy root fallback) · existing `assets/workshops/*.md` (optional; legacy root fallback) · domain registry (optional, domain mode ON only)
**Flags**: `<plan>` (ordinal, slug, or path) + `"<topic>"` · `--from-spec` (pick from the spec's Workshop Opportunities) · `--list` (list existing workshops)
**Produces**: `${PLAN_DIR}/assets/workshops/<NNN>-<topic-slug>.md` (typed design doc with value frame, proof levels, evidence ledger) + terminal success block (type, proof level, value axes, key questions, related workshops)
**Side effects**: none

---

## Procedure

Create a **decision-focused design note** that resolves a complex concept. Workshops are working reference documents - practical, concrete, and useful during implementation.

> Elegance: a workshop is **output** — a working reference, not an essay. Diagrams, tables, schemas, and real examples over prose; reach the target proof level and stop. Doctrine + the seven-function line test: `references/00-routing.md` § Shared conventions.

```md
User input:

$ARGUMENTS
# Expected argument forms (flags are this verb's own — the flow renders the full command):
# <plan> "<topic>"           # Workshop a specific topic
# <plan> --from-spec         # Pick from spec's Workshop Opportunities
# <plan> --list              # List existing workshops
#
# Examples:
# 003-workflow-service "CLI command flows"
# workflow-service "WorkUnit data model"
# 003-workflow-service --from-spec
```

## Purpose

Create focused design notes for concepts that benefit from resolution before architecture. These are **working reference documents** - something a developer, reviewer, stakeholder, or agent would actually keep open during implementation.

A workshop should improve value delivery by reducing the time, ambiguity, risk, or human attention required to move from intent to implementation-ready evidence.

## When to Use

- Concept has multiple valid implementation approaches
- External interfaces or contracts need detailed specification  
- Data structures will be referenced by multiple components
- CLI/UX flow has branching paths or complex state
- Storage format decisions affect future extensibility
- Schema changes have migration implications
- You need stakeholder alignment on design details
- Feasibility is unproven and only *running code* can settle it (Spike/POC)

## Workshop Types & Suggested Formats

| Type | Best Formats | Example Content |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **CLI Flow** | ASCII box diagrams, terminal examples, command tables | Command syntax, output formats, error codes |
| **Data Model** | TypeScript types, JSON Schema, mermaid ER diagrams | Entity relationships, validation rules, examples |
| **API Contract** | OpenAPI snippets, request/response examples, sequence diagrams | Endpoints, payloads, error responses |
| **State Machine** | Mermaid state diagrams, transition tables | States, events, guards, actions |
| **Integration Pattern** | Sequence diagrams, interface definitions | Protocols, contracts, failure modes |
| **Storage Design** | File trees, YAML/JSON examples, migration paths | Directory structure, file formats, versioning |
| **Spike/POC** | Runnable throwaway code + captured real output | The question, what was run, actual output, go/no-go verdict, promoted learnings |

**Format is flexible** - use whatever representation best clarifies the concept. Mix formats freely.

## Workshop Value Thesis

A workshop improves value delivery when it reduces the time and human attention required to move from ambiguous intent to implementation-ready evidence.

A workshop is working when a fresh human or agent can enter the topic, understand the relevant context, reach the target proof level, and leave behind evidence or encoded learning that makes the next loop cheaper.

Measure the workshop by its ability to produce verified useful decisions, reusable examples, explicit contracts, and validated learning per unit of human attention.

This deliberately avoids "we made a better document." Better at what? More detailed? Longer? Easier to admire? The stronger claim is that ambiguity, rediscovery, review burden, implementation risk, and coordination cost are becoming cheaper, safer, and more repeatable.

## Value Axis Selection

Each workshop should identify the value axes most relevant to the topic.

Value axes are not fixed roles or mandatory categories. They are lenses for explaining how the workshop makes future work cheaper, safer, clearer, or more repeatable.

The workshop agent should:

1. Select 3-5 value axes that best fit the topic
2. Prefer axes that explain concrete downstream value
3. Add custom axes when the suggested list does not fit
4. Avoid filling every axis mechanically
5. Use the selected axes to shape examples, evidence, validation, and success criteria

Suggested axes include:

| Axis | Use When The Workshop Needs To Improve... |
|------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Strategic Value** | Alignment with business, product, platform, or architectural goals |
| **Operator Usability** | How humans actually use the system during real work |
| **Implementation Readiness** | Whether developers or agents can build from the workshop |
| **Proof Quality** | Whether claims are backed by examples, tests, traces, schemas, or evidence |
| **Safety to Change** | Whether future changes can happen without hidden breakage |
| **Review Compression** | Whether reviewers can evaluate work faster and more objectively |
| **Onboarding / Accessibility** | Whether a fresh person or agent can understand the topic quickly |
| **Knowability** | Whether hidden system behavior has been made explicit |
| **Agent Readiness** | Whether an agent can act on the workshop with minimal clarification |
| **Learning Compounding** | Whether the workshop captures decisions so future loops avoid rediscovery |
| **Migration Safety** | Whether transition paths, compatibility, and rollback are clear |
| **Cross-Domain Coordination** | Whether domain boundaries, contracts, and handoffs are explicit |
| **Operational Reliability** | Whether failure modes, monitoring, recovery, and support paths are understood |
| **User Experience** | Whether user-visible flows, errors, feedback, and expectations are clear |
| **Cost / Attention Reduction** | Whether the workshop makes a future loop cheaper in human effort |

The agent may add, remove, rename, or combine axes when another framing better explains the workshop's value.

### Example Value Framings

These are examples only. The workshop agent should choose the framing that best fits the topic.

**Strategic-style framing**:
This workshop improves value delivery when it makes the planned system more accessible, more knowable, and safer to change.

**Operator-style framing**:
This workshop is working when a fresh human or agent can enter the topic, use the reference material, reach the target proof level, and leave behind evidence that makes the next loop cheaper.

**Measurement-style framing**:
Measure this workshop by its ability to produce verified useful decisions, examples, contracts, and learning per unit of human attention.

## Proof Levels

Each workshop should state its target proof level and current proof level.

| Proof Level | Meaning | Typical Evidence |
|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **Orientation** | Reader understands the topic and why it matters | Purpose, context, glossary, boundaries |
| **Decision Space** | Reader understands options and tradeoffs | Options table, constraints, pros/cons |
| **Preferred Direction** | Workshop recommends a design direction | Recommendation, rationale, rejected alternatives |
| **Contract Ready** | Interfaces, schemas, states, commands, or flows are specified | Types, schemas, examples, diagrams, error cases |
| **Implementation Ready** | Developer or agent can build from it with minimal clarification | Acceptance criteria, edge cases, validation rules, test scenarios |
| **Validated** | The design has been checked against implementation, tests, prototype output, or real usage | Test results, prototype output, review notes, migration evidence |


## Execution Flow

### 1) Parse Input & Resolve Plan

```python
# Pseudo-code
def resolve_plan(input):
    # If input looks like "003-slug" or full path
    if matches(r'^\d{3}-') or input.startswith('docs/plans/'):
        return find_plan_by_path(input)
    
    # Otherwise it's a slug - find matching plan
    for folder in list_folders('docs/plans/'):
        if folder.endswith(f'-{slugify(input)}'):
            return f'docs/plans/{folder}'
    
    error(f'Plan not found: {input}')
```

### 2) Handle Modes

**--list mode**: Show existing workshops
```
Workshops in docs/plans/003-workflow-service/:
  001-cli-command-flows.md (CLI Flow) - Created 2024-01-15
  002-workunit-data-model.md (Data Model) - Created 2024-01-16
  
Run this verb again with: 003-workflow-service "<topic>" to create new
```

**--from-spec mode**: Read spec's Workshop Opportunities and prompt user to select
```
Workshop Opportunities from spec:

| # | Topic | Type | Status |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | CLI command flows | CLI Flow | Not started |
| 2 | WorkUnit data model | Data Model | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | State transitions | State Machine | Not started |

Select topic number (or 'all' to create all): _
```

**Direct topic mode**: Create workshop for specified topic

### 3) Check for Existing Workshop & Determine Ordinal

- Scan `${PLAN_DIR}/assets/workshops/` (legacy root `workshops/` too — § Plan-folder layout, `references/00-routing.md`) for existing files matching `NNN-*.md` pattern
- Determine next ordinal: highest NNN + 1 (zero-pad to 3 digits, start at 001)
- Check if a workshop with matching topic-slug already exists (any ordinal)
- If exists: Ask whether to update existing or create new
- If not exists: Create new with next ordinal
- WORKSHOP_FILE = `${PLAN_DIR}/assets/workshops/${ORD}-${topic-slug}.md` (create the folder if missing)

### 4) Gather Context

1. **Read the business source** — the `## Business Specification` section of `${PLAN_DIR}/<slug>-plan.md` (unified) when present, else a legacy `${PLAN_DIR}/<slug>-spec.md`
   - Extract Workshop Opportunity details if topic matches
   - Note key questions to answer
   - Understand feature context

2. **Read research dossier** (if exists)
   - Extract relevant findings for this topic
   - Note existing patterns and conventions

3. **Read related workshops** (if any)
   - Understand cross-references needed
   - Maintain consistency

4. **Load domain context**
   - Load domain context per `references/00-routing.md` § Domain mode & context loading (OFF by default — when OFF, skip domain context entirely)
   - Note existing contracts and composition — the workshop design should respect domain boundaries
   - If the workshop is designing a new service/adapter/model, check which domain it belongs to
   - If the topic spans multiple domains, note the cross-domain contracts needed

5. **Identify the value frame**
   - Select 3-5 value axes that best fit the workshop topic
   - Define the target proof level and current proof level
   - Identify the downstream loop this workshop should make cheaper, safer, clearer, or more repeatable
   - Decide what evidence the workshop should produce: examples, schemas, diagrams, test scenarios, state tables, command outputs, decision tables, or other proof artifacts

### 5) Create Workshop Document

**Required Header**:

```

#### Spike/POC Workshop Pattern

The one workshop type that **writes and runs code** — the smallest throwaway program that answers a feasibility question with observed behaviour instead of belief. Target proof level is **Validated** by construction. Ground rules:

- **Throwaway location, always**: the repo's gitignored scratch dir if it has one, else the session scratchpad / system temp — **never** the shipping source tree; nothing may import it.
- **Smallest code that answers the question** — no error handling, no structure, no tests. If it grows past a screen or two, the question was too big: split it.
- **Real output is the evidence.** Paste actual command output/measurements into the workshop doc; a spike with no captured run proves nothing.
- **Promote learnings, never code.** The verdict + discovered constraints flow back into the plan (re-run the plan verb to fold them in); the spike code is dead the moment the question is answered.

```markdown
## Question

[The single feasibility question, e.g. "Can library X stream partial results, or does it buffer the full response?"]

**Why a spike**: [why no design note can answer this — only running code]

## What We Ran

Location: `scratch/poc/<topic>/` (throwaway — gitignored, never imported)

​```bash
$ python poc_stream.py
[actual captured output]
​```

## Verdict

**PROVEN | DISPROVEN | PARTIAL**

| Claim tested | Observed | Evidence |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| [claim] | [what actually happened] | [output line / measurement] |

## Learnings to Promote

- [Constraint discovered → where it lands in the plan]
- [Assumption corrected → which phase/task it changes]

## Discarded

Spike code at [location] is throwaway. Nothing to merge.
```

### 6) Output

**Save to**: `${PLAN_DIR}/assets/workshops/${ORD}-${topic-slug}.md`

**Success message**:
```
✅ Workshop created: docs/plans/003-workflow-service/assets/workshops/cli-command-flows.md

Type: CLI Flow
Target Proof Level: Implementation Ready
Selected Value Axes: Operator Usability, Review Compression, Agent Readiness
Key Questions Addressed: 3
Status: Draft

Related workshops in this plan:
  - workunit-data-model.md (Data Model)

Refinement:
  - Review and refine the workshop document
  - Mark as 'Approved' when design is finalized
```

## Workshop Document Principles

1. **Practical & Concrete** - Show real examples, actual output, not abstract descriptions
2. **Multiple Representations** - Same concept as diagrams, tables, code - whatever aids understanding
3. **Show Don't Tell** - `$ command` with output, not "the command shows..."
4. **Decision Rationale** - "**Why this format**:" sections explaining choices
5. **Quick Reference** - Summary tables, cheatsheets for implementation
6. **Error Handling** - What can go wrong, error codes, recovery
7. **Open Questions** - Track with RESOLVED/OPEN status
8. **Progressive Examples** - Simple case first, then variations
9. **Working Reference Feel** - Something to keep open during implementation
10. **Value Axis Fit** - Select the axes that explain this workshop's concrete downstream value
11. **Proof Level Clarity** - State what level of confidence or validation the workshop is trying to reach
12. **Evidence Trail** - Leave behind diagrams, examples, schemas, test scenarios, tables, or other proof artifacts
13. **Fresh Entrant Test** - A new human or agent can enter the topic and act without reconstructing missing context

## Integration with neighbouring verbs (via artifacts — the wire protocol)

### From the specify verb
- The spec identifies Workshop Opportunities
- This verb's `--from-spec` flag picks from that list

### Into the architect verb
- The architect checks for `assets/workshops/*.md` (legacy root `workshops/`) in the plan folder
- Incorporates workshop decisions into phase planning (they are authoritative)
- Reduces discovery work for workshopped topics
- References workshop documents in relevant phases

### Standalone Use
- Can be run anytime during planning
- Topic doesn't need to be in spec's Workshop Opportunities
- Useful for ad-hoc deep dives

## Success Criteria

✅ **Answers key questions**: Workshop addresses the questions that prompted it
✅ **Value thesis stated**: Workshop explains how it makes validated work cheaper, safer, clearer, or more repeatable
✅ **Selected value axes fit the topic**: Axes are chosen deliberately, not filled mechanically
✅ **Proof level clear**: Target and current proof levels are explicit
✅ **Fresh entrant ready**: A new human or agent can understand the topic and act without reconstructing missing context
✅ **Concrete examples**: Real data, actual output, working code
✅ **Multiple formats**: Uses appropriate mix of diagrams, tables, code, prose
✅ **Decision clarity**: Design choices are explicit with rationale
✅ **Evidence produced**: Workshop leaves behind reusable examples, contracts, schemas, test scenarios, decision tables, or other proof artifacts
✅ **Attention reducing**: The next implementation, review, testing, migration, onboarding, or agent loop requires less clarification
✅ **Implementation ready when required**: Developer or agent can use this as reference during coding when the target proof level requires it
✅ **Consistent structure**: Header metadata present, related docs linked
✅ **Open questions tracked**: Unresolved items marked clearly

## Exit

Print the output-contract summary (✅ block: what was produced, where, key fields). Then STOP. Do not name a next stage. If invoked standalone, end with exactly: "Routing is the flow's job — run the parent flow bare to continue."
