# Soft Factory Runner

Use the short-lived local `soft-factory` CLI as the sole operational interface.
Run `soft-factory instructions --json` to discover the Runner-owned RPIV integration contract, including failed terminal progress, immutable active-run validation snapshots, and independently observed final-head pull-request binding. Run `soft-factory doctor --json` for authoritative repository readiness and use
`soft-factory run --issue <number>` only when a caller explicitly supplies the
issue. Delegate status, reconciliation, resume, stop, logs, attach, inventory,
and cleanup to their documented Runner commands. Never create a competing
worktree, lock, state, process, completion, or cleanup control path.
